<p> I love writing code. Building something useful that is helpful and makes one's life or work easier makes me happy.</p>
<p>I'm a native of Seattle, WA and have worked in numerous parts of the Seattle Tech Industry. Before DevOps was a formal thing I was a linux cloud engineer and also worked closely with customers. </p>
<p>I find the best way to learn something is to build a project and dig through the underpinnings of the code, hopefully learning something along the way. My latest project is a fully WSGI compliant web framework integrated with Gunicorn and NGINX. (It's hosting this very webpage.)</p>
